Clients connect to server using TCP protocol:

In order to stablish a connection, they need to provide a user and a password
in a given format:
    'user password'
    <user> must use the format <displayname>#<4-digit tag> (ie Example#1234)
    <password> should be encripted, as it will be stored as given by user

IMPORTANT: If the user is new, it will be registered using the password given, if the user name already exists, it will check the given password with the stored password.

Once the client is connected, via TCP, it can launch queries in order to perform different actions. 

Whenever it requires a chat log update, the petition will be done by a TCP query but client should give an UDP ip:port address in order to receive the information from the server.


Chat logs are stored under the local/ dir as .bin files.
Registered users can also be found under local/ inside the users.bin
Existing groups can be found on a file called groups.bin, inside the /local dir

queries:
    b'!updatechat@<uid/group> -> <dirIpUDPsocket>'
     <uid/group>: 
        user1_user2 (if chat) Where <userX> is <displayName#tag> for user X
        groupName_group (if group) Must add b'_group' to groupName
     <dirIpUDPsocket>:
        '127.0.0.1:port' UDP dir serveer will send chat logs to
    b'!msg-<msgContent> -> <target>
     <msgContent>:
        body of the msg, should addd the username as a prefix (Uname:message)
     <target>:
        displayname#tag (if private msg)
        groupName (if group)
    b'!create -> <groupName>'
     <groupName>:
        Name of the group, cant be repeated with existing groups
